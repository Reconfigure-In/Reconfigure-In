            <section>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Project Radar is a sophisticated web mining tool designed to locate information based on user
                    queries. It leverages advanced AI models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to
                    provide accurate and relevant search results. This document provides an overview of Project Radar,
                    its functionality, and the underlying technology.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <h3>AI Model Integration</h3>
                <p>Project Radar integrates multiple AI models to enhance search accuracy. These models analyze and
                    interpret user queries to understand intent and context. The AI models use natural language
                    processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to generate meaningful results.</p>

                <h3>Information Retrieval RAG Pipelines</h3>
                <p>The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are a key component of Project Radar. RAG
                    pipelines combine retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve information retrieval.
                    Here's a brief overview of the process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Query Understanding:</strong> The user query is processed by AI models to extract key
                        terms and context.</li>
                    <li><strong>Information Retrieval:</strong> Relevant documents and data are retrieved from a vast
                        corpus using retrieval techniques.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contextual Generation:</strong> The retrieved information is used by generative models
                        to produce coherent and contextually appropriate responses.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                <h3>Algorithm Overview</h3>
                <p>The core algorithm of Project Radar involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Query Parsing:</strong> Parsing and understanding the user query using NLP techniques.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Document Retrieval:</strong> Using efficient indexing and search algorithms to retrieve
                        relevant documents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Response Generation:</strong> Generating responses based on retrieved documents and
                        query context.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>System Architecture</h3>
                <p>Project Radar's system architecture includes the following components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Corpus:</strong> A large-scale database of indexed documents and information.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Models:</strong> Pre-trained models for query understanding and response generation.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Search Engine:</strong> A high-performance search engine for document retrieval.</li>
                    <li><strong>API Interface:</strong> An interface for interacting with the system and receiving
                        results.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Performance and Scalability</h2>
                <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
                <p>Project Radar is designed to handle large volumes of queries and data efficiently. Performance
                    metrics include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Query Response Time:</strong> Time taken to process and return results for a user query.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The relevance and correctness of the search results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Ability to scale with increasing data and query load.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scalability Considerations</h3>
                <p>To ensure scalability, Project Radar uses distributed computing techniques and optimized data storage
                    solutions. The system can be scaled horizontally to accommodate growing data and user demands.</p>

                <h2>Usage</h2>
                <p>To use Project Radar, you need to interact with the API interface. Here is a basic example of how to
                    perform a query:</p>
<pre><code>POST /query
Content-Type: application/json

{
"query": "Find information about AI advancements"
}
</code></pre>
                <p>The API will return a response with relevant information based on the provided query.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>For instance, if a user queries "latest trends in machine learning," Project Radar will:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Parse the query to understand the key terms.</li>
                    <li>Retrieve relevant documents about recent trends in machine learning.</li>
                    <li>Generate a response summarizing the latest trends based on the retrieved documents.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The response will provide a coherent and contextually accurate summary of the latest trends in
                    machine learning.</p>
