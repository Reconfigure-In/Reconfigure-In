            <h2>Lighting Speed Encryption</h2>
        </center>
        <p>The Baseline project is a C program designed to implement a fundamental encryption algorithm. This algorithm
            demonstrates core cryptographic techniques, including key scheduling, permutation, XOR operations, and
            nonlinear transformations to securely encode input strings. This document offers a comprehensive overview of
            the algorithm's design, operational complexity, and additional technical insights.</p>

        <h2>Algorithm Description</h2>
        <h3>Key Schedule Generation</h3>
        <p>The key schedule in this encryption algorithm is established using two 32-bit keys and a configurable number
            of rounds. For each round, a specific byte value is computed based on the provided keys and the round
            number. This byte value plays a crucial role in the permutation and XOR operations performed during the
            encryption process, ensuring a robust transformation of the input data. </p>
        <h2>Complexity Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Time Complexity</h3>
        <p>The time complexity of the encryption algorithm is O(n * r), where n represents the size of the input array
            and r denotes the number of rounds. This complexity arises because each round requires processing the entire
            array, and the total number of rounds influences the overall time required for encryption. </p>
        <h3>Space Complexity</h3>
        <p>The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), accounting for the storage needs of the input array, the
            encrypted output array, the random addition array, and the key schedule. This complexity assumes that the
            size of these arrays scales proportionally with n, the size of the input data. </p>
